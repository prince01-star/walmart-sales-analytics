# 📊 Walmart Sales Analytics | End-to-End Data Analytics Project

An end-to-end data analytics project that transforms raw Walmart transactional data into actionable business insights using **Python, MySQL, and Power BI**.

This project showcases the complete analytics lifecycle — from data extraction and cleaning to visualization and strategic recommendations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Retail organizations generate massive amounts of transactional data daily. Without proper analysis, identifying sales trends, customer behavior, and operational inefficiencies becomes challenging.

This project analyzes Walmart sales data to uncover patterns that help improve profitability, optimize inventory, enhance customer satisfaction, and support data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Walmart operates across multiple branches and handles thousands of transactions. The leadership team requires a centralized analytics solution to:

- Track sales performance across branches  
- Identify top-performing product categories  
- Understand customer purchasing behavior  
- Analyze payment trends

- Improve strategic decision-making  

This project builds an interactive dashboard and performs deep analysis to solve these business challenges.
